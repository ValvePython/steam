    pip install -U steam

Installing directly from ``github`` repository:

.. code:: bash

    # cutting edge from master
    pip install 'git+https://github.com/ValvePython/steam#egg=steam'

    # specific version tag (e.g. v1.0.0)
    pip install 'git+https://github.com/ValvePython/steam@v1.0.0#egg=steam[client]'
    # without SteamClient extras
    pip install 'git+https://github.com/ValvePython/steam@v1.0.0#egg=steam'

Vagrant
-------

The repo includes a `Vagrantfile` to setup enviroment for expermentation and development.
We assume you've already have ``vagrant`` and ``virtualbox`` set up.
The VM is ``Ubuntu 16.04`` with all necessary packages installed, and virtualenv for ``python2`` and ``python3``.


.. code:: bash

    vagrant up    # spin the VM and let it setup
    vagrant ssh
    # for python2
    $ source venv2/bin/activate
    # for python3
    $ source venv3/bin/activate



Local Testing
-------------

To run the test suite with the current ``python``, use

.. code:: bash

    make test

To run for specific version, setup a virtual environment

.. code:: bash

    virtualenv -p python3 py3
    source py3/bin/active
